"2 A margin of error is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the margin of error  in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. Margins of error shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
